# Stakeholder Report: Lacrosse Team Performance Improvement

## Purpose
Provide actionable recommendations to improve the lacrosse team’s performance for the next season, focusing on player development and strategy adjustments.

## Executive Summary
### Recommendations and Risk Levels:
1. **Recommendation**: Increase shot attempts for Olivia Adamson and Emma Tyrrell (low risk).
   - **Rationale**: Both players have high shooting percentages and can increase their shot volume to significantly boost the team's offensive performance. 
   - **Confidence**: High. Based on historical data, increasing attempts should result in more goals without compromising shooting accuracy.

2. **Recommendation**: Target coaching to reduce turnovers for Katie Goodale (medium risk).
   - **Rationale**: Goodale has a high turnover rate. Coaching to reduce turnovers in high-pressure situations (e.g., late-game) would improve team performance.
   - **Confidence**: Moderate. A focused coaching plan could reduce turnovers, though outcomes are not guaranteed.

3. **Recommendation**: Experiment with new player lineups (high risk).
   - **Rationale**: Tweaking player roles could increase offensive efficiency. However, this change may have unintended consequences, such as disrupting team chemistry.
   - **Confidence**: Low to moderate. This change requires more data and testing.

## Background & Decision Question
The decision question is: "How can the lacrosse team improve its offensive and defensive performance for the upcoming season?"

The report analyzes past performance data from the team and offers coaching recommendations based on the analysis.

## Data & Methods
- **Data**: The data consists of player performance metrics (goals per game, shooting percentages, turnovers, etc.) from the last lacrosse season.
- **Methods**: Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and uncertainty measures (bootstrap estimates and confidence intervals) to validate the reliability of findings.

## Findings
### Key Insights:
- **Offensive Improvements**: Increasing shot attempts for key players like Adamson and Tyrrell can lead to significant offensive gains.
- **Turnover Reduction**: Coaching interventions for players like Goodale can help reduce turnovers, especially in high-stress situations.
- **Player Impact**: Players with high turnover rates are negatively affecting the team's performance. Training interventions are needed to minimize errors.

### Visualizations:

### Uncertainty:
Confidence intervals were calculated for shooting percentage improvements. Results show a **high confidence** in increasing attempts without sacrificing shooting accuracy.

## Recommendations
### Low-Risk Recommendations:
- Increase shot attempts for Adamson and Tyrrell (improving offensive output).
- Focus on shooting drills and quality shots.

### Medium-Risk Recommendations:
- Implement a turnover reduction plan for Goodale.
- Test new player lineups to improve balance without disrupting team dynamics.

### High-Risk Recommendations:
- Significant lineup changes require careful monitoring to avoid negative effects on team chemistry.

## Ethical / Legal Concerns
- **Privacy**: Player performance data must be handled with care to ensure privacy, especially for underage athletes.
- **Fairness**: Ensure no biases in player evaluations, and that all players are treated equitably in performance assessments.

## Next Steps & Validation Plan
- Collect additional data through controlled practices or games to further validate coaching interventions.
- Monitor turnover rates and shooting efficiency closely to assess improvements.
- Re-assess player roles and adapt coaching strategies based on real-time performance.
